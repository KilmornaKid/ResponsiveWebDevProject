  <h1>Welcome To Hi-Fi Electrical</h1> 
  <h2>Who Are We?</h2>
  <div class="content">
  <p>Hi-Fi Electrical is one of the world's leading electrical installation companies for various multi-national corporations. We have been an established business since 2003 starting out as a small-time contractor, in the U.S and growing in both domestic and eventually foreign markets and we have not stopped growing as a company ever since. Our success and reputation built over many years has allowed us the opportunity to pursue different more localised markets. </p>
    <p>For instance, recently we have decided to expand our operations into local chain stores across several country's offering a wide variety of services for individuals to take advantage of. This new service will  mainly focus on home tv installation however It will also include the installation of broadband and other tasks suited to an electrician. </p>
    <p>This is of course a completely new area of the market for us so it may take some time to expand our operations to a local area near you however we are moving faster than previously due to the success of a local trial run in the United States so please rest assured if we are not in a store near you today we will be tomorrow! </p>
    <p>As a way to celebrate the launch of this new website and division of the company we are excited to announce that we are partnering with the broadcast company Sky as we launch our services in Ireland, the United Kingdom, Netherlands, France, Germany and Belgium. We are of course running special offers and deals for installations for any new Sky customers in the next six weeks. </p>
    <p>Of course, in the upcoming months we will be running many more deals for cheaper and better installations as well as several competitions over social media for which the winners will receive custom home cinema setups worth over 6 grand each in total!</p>
    <p>At any rate we humbly welcome you to the site. Please feel to browse our many services and we hope that they match your expectations and if they don't please contact us and say so, as we are currently looking for all the feedback we can get.</p>

      <h3>Our Experience</h3>
      <p class="disspar">Although the company does not have much experience in installations for individuals we do in fact have many talented electricians who have installed massive systems for several big corporations managing this new division and it is worth mentioning that we are in fact currently hiring locally per store.This is of course a completely new area of the market for us so it may take some time to expand our operations to a local area near you however we are moving faster than previously due to the success of a local trial run in the United States so please rest assured if we are not in a store near you today we will be tomorrow!</p>
      <p class="disspar">It should also be noted that we are in fact the number one company according to all of these corporations all of whom remain to this day loyal customers. We have however questioned our ability to tackle this endeavour ourselves this is why we decided to begin by deploying a short trial run in America to gauge interest in our service and to see if we could break into this market. The answer on both accounts we think is a resounding yes!  </p>
      <p>Ultimately, our expansion into this market was inevitable due to both the demand for high end setups devised by experts and the fact that the gap that is this market remained untapped by any competition. If our track record has proved anything its that we are up to the task of building a respectable fast and reliable service which the customers can put their trust in.    </p>

  <div class="content">
    <p>We here at hifi pride ourselves on being dedicated to our craft, knowing all there is to know about the newest hardware and software for television, broadband and other types of electrical installation. We also work closely with the manufacturers of several different technology companies to recommend new approaches to their hardware and software as well as provide feedback from the customers.</p>
    <p>With these closely formed relationships we are often able to forge exclusive deals with certain companies that allow customers to obtain the current cutting edge technology that these companies produce earlier and cheaper then offered at other retailers. </p>
    <p>Our service are slowly but surely spreading across the globe and within several years we will have stores widely available in every country. We hope to see you there!</p>

      <h3>Our Goals</h3>
      
      <p class="disspar">Our goals for the future of this division are two fold. Firstly we intend for hifi to grow to a global level business one in which the customers, employees and manufactures of tech products  can grow to trust. </p>  
      <p class="disspar">Secondly, we would like to continue to improve and hone our services to try and reach different audiences. The making of this division is in some ways simply a first step in expanding our business interests by delivering a sought after service. </p>
      <p>Overall our end goal is to breach a new market on a global scale and provide our target customer with the high spec, high end and highly tuned home set-ups. We hope to achieve this soon and look forward to gaining insight in sight  into how we can improve in the coming years.</p>

    <p>One other area we have been looking into is on the computer end of things, even thought we already set up broadband and basic routers we have considered moving into the custom PC space. As video games continue to grow in popularity so too do the needs of the people playing these games. Alot of  these players need high end speced gaming PCs to play the lastest games. This is where we would come in, anyone who needed a new machine would simply send us the specs and we would build the machine for them for a discount of course. We are currently in talks with certain companies however nothing is set in stone just yet.</p>

       <h3>Future Expansion</h3>
      <p class="disspar">Currently we are expanding at a rapid rate with incredible growth each financial year. Our service as of right now is only set up in the capital cities of several country,s including Ireland, England, France and Germany. The plan is to use these initial stores as flagships testing the waters for what kind of business proposals are significant and which aren't.    </p>
      <p class="disspar">For example, you can add a matching cover page, header, and sidebar. Click Insert and then choose the elements you want from the different galleries. Themes and styles also help keep your document coordinated. When you click Design and choose a new Theme, the pictures, charts, and SmartArt graphics change to match your new theme.</p>
      <p>What we are aiming for, really is to increase our market share and deliver the best possible service to the largest percentage of customers possible.</p>

<div class="content">
    
    <p>What makes us the best choice for your electrical and technological needs is the fact that we have significant experience with companies both as clients looking to buy form and as contractors looking to work for various corps. We have numerous connections throughout the television markets and all of our employees have racked up years of experience on advanced set-ups.</p>
    <p>We also have a highly competitive price range which companies fail to beat us on, this is mainly due to our extensive and exhaustive research accomplished by our management staff who handle not only management of the staff but logistics as well. If you do happen to find a price that beats ours by all means tell us and we will lower our price matching the comparative service to accommodate your financial needs.</p>
    <p>To put it bluntly, you will find a better, cheaper or faster and more knowledgeable crew then the men and women working for Hi-Fi Electrical. We not only know every thing there is to know about the latest tech but we're also the best when it comes to bang for your buck! So please feel free to contact us for all your setup needs.</p>
