      <h2>TV Installation</h2>
      <p>Our leading service is the installation of various screens form PC Monitor to Smart TVs. The price range differs depending on what service you are requesting, for example installing and setting up a smart tv on its own will not cost more than 80 euro however setting up broadband for the house the price increases thought not substantially. While we would love to list out our entire price range the truth is that there are so many variables that the best way to get a fixed price is to call us and receive a direct quote. You will however find a short general price range in the next few paragraphs from which prices are unlikely to veer far off of.</p>
  </div>
</div>

 <div class="content">
    <p>Tv installation by itself proves relativity cheap at 80 euro, however several factors can change the price rather dramatically. Firstly, whether or not you buying the tv off of us obviously you must pay for the tv but there is also delivery charge of 20 euro to consider. Secondly if the tv is a smart tv than it will probably require a home broadband set up to take full advantage of the sets smart features and while we can install broadband, routers and set it up for you this can increase the cost significantly. </p>
    <div class ="disspar2">
    <p>We are also offering to set up home machines whether they be laptops or desktops we can set up both for you however again different tasks will be priced differently according to the variables in play. For example, setting up a conventional laptop straight off of the shelf will be much cheaper than assembling a custom PC gaming rig. Again, please contact us for an exact quote.</p>
    <p>Of course, we also deal in maintained and repair of conventional electricians such as lights, fuse boxes and faulty wiring. Again, same rules as before apply prices may vary from situation to situation although no matter what if an electrician does call out to your home you will be charged 30 euro for travel fees.</p>

     <h2>Partnership with Sky</h2>
     <p>As a kickstart to our new expanding business Hi-Fi has partnered with the broadcast company Sky to bring you, the customers, some amazing deals on subscriptions from them and on some tech form us. If you ever choose to use us to install your home tv network and you want to get Sky we would highly recommend the offer we have in play which will sign you up to Sky for a third of the price when you buy one of our higher tier tv/Blu-ray combo sets. Hurry though this offer only lasts for the first six months. </p>

 <div class="content">
    <p>VIf you think this deal with a major broadcasting network is a one off then there's good news we several similar deals lining up after this one and we are currently in talks with several hardware companies to discuss discounts on various TVs and Blu-rays as well as various computer manufacturers to discuss sale prices for cutting edge laptops. </p>
    <div class ="disspar2">
    <p>It's also important that you pay attention to this site as we will be hosting a few competitions in which the winners stand to gain some massive prices worth several grand each. These competitions will be run sporadically across several social media accounts so there are plenty of chances to win big.</p>
    <p>Of course, we have smaller prizes for the runners up such as discounts on your next installation, free 1TB hard drives, and even a 24'inch television which could be yours if you play your cards right. </p>
    </div>
    <p>Don't forget that minors, (anyone under 18) cannot enter this competitions however the winner of the competitions will get to decided where the set up is displayed, so if you wish for a parent or guarding to enter on your behalf that is fine with us. </p>

      <h2>Internet Set-Up</h2>
      <p>As mentioned earlier, our technicians are highly skilled in more than one area and can also set up various router/modems in different ways so as to accommodate you with a safe, secure and reliable network. We here at HI-FI have gone out of way to cultivate Beneficial deals on behalf of our loyal customers with several isps (internet service providers). This of course gave us the chance to expand our installation deals with Vodaphone giving us the chance to slash their fee for the first year as long as we preform the installation.</p>

    <p>One thing that's worth scrutinizing is our credentials. How and why we got where we are? Why are they considered so good? Who hired them previously? Well to that last question we have an answer or rather a former employer who we believe has the answers to the previous questions so hopefully you'll be satisfied. </p>
    <p>Gabe Newell - Head of Valve:</p>
    <p>"So, when we first started our company we never imagined it would grow so quick, in fact we often thought the opposite that it would fail miserably so we planned for that. However, what we didn't plan for was success and by the time we realised this we were in too deep, we needed a new building, new hardware and the spaces that were good were too expensive but there was one place that could, only problem was it was stripped down, no electricity, no running water.  We tell the estate agent who says he knows a company that can fix it up in this time for this much and we don't believe him, but we had choice. A month later we were awe struck. It was like a miracle. Difference was night and day. All I know is if that's what they can do for company I love to see the kind of work they produce for individuals set-ups."" </p>
