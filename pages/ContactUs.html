  <div class="content">
    <p>Every company recognises the importance of clear, concise, communication occurring directly between the company and the customer. At HI-Fi we pride ourselves on those precise quality's, as we attribute a great deal of our success to the importance of a back and forth dialog about various subjects such as cost, quality of service, interest in brand and criticism. So it should come as no surprise that we not only hope that you will contact our staff we actively encourage it.</p>
    <p>For example, you can add a matching cover page, header, and sidebar. Click Insert and then choose the elements you want from the different galleries. Themes and styles also help keep your document coordinated. When you click Design and choose a new Theme, the pictures, charts, and SmartArt graphics change to match your new theme.</p>

      <h3>Our Location</h3>
      <p>Opening Hours: 10:00 - 17:00 Monday - Friday</p>

In Europe we have three central offices one located in County Dublin, Ireland the second located in London, England and finally the third main office is located in Berlin, Germany. These new offices offer a golden opportunity for us to manage the company in more proactive and less reactive way. </p>
      <p>The benefits of course are also shared by the customer as you will be met with a more flexible support staff which you can contact during regular hours and of course if you wish to meet face to face to discuss any problems or issues that you may have had with the company by all means call us and ask for an appointment, our staff will be more than glad to help you with whatever problem crops up!</p>
